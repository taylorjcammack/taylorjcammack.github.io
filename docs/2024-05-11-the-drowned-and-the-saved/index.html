        <p>I&#039;ve just finished reading Primo Levi&#039;s last book, <em>The Drowned and the Saved</em> (1986), which served as a summation of his experience at Auschwitz and grapples with the complications in the transmission of the lessons of the Holocaust as the events themselves recede in living memory.</p><p>Quick aside: had a personal copy of the book, traveled to Tulsa for a cousin&#039;s wedding and left it in the sheets of an unmade hotel room bed. The event was a blessing as it freed me from the interminable notations scribbled in the margins by the previous owner. </p><p>Next to a paragraph on the culpability of the average German, aware of the intense political subjugation and persecution of the Jews, the commentary in faded pencil: </p><p>&quot;They knew.&quot;  </p><p>On the transmutation of memory by the guilty perpetrators:</p><blockquote><p>An extreme case of the distortion of the memory of a committed guilty act is found in it&#039;s suppression... it is a fossilized lie, rigidified in a formula. The rememberer has decided not to remember and has succeeded: by dint of denying its existence, he has expelled the harmful memory as one expels an excretion of a parasite (Chp. 1, &quot;The Memory of the Offense&quot;)</p></blockquote><p>The sterling observation:</p><p>&quot;Parasite.&quot;</p><p>The perils of buying used books. </p><p>Anyway, wanted to highlight a couple contemporarily relevant passages from the final chapter &quot;Letters from Germans&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>I repeat: the true crime, the collective, general crime of almost all Germans of that time was that of lacking the courage to speak.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On Israel:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Desperate, the Jewish survivors in flight from Europe after the great shipwreck have created in the bosom of the Arab world an island of Western civilization, a portentous palingenesis of Judaism, and the pretext for renewed hatred.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On the so-called &quot;Long Peace&quot; (emphasis mine):</strong></p><blockquote><p>There are no problems that cannot be solved around a table, provided there is good will and reciprocal trust - or even reciprocal feat, as the present interminable stalled situation in which the greatest powers confront each other with cordial or threatening faces but <strong><u>have no restraint when it comes to unleashing (or allowing the unleashing) of bloody wars among those &quot;protected&quot; by them</u></strong>, supplying sophisticated weapons, spies, mercenaries, and military advisors instead of arbiters of peace.</p></blockquote><p>Pic unrelated.</p>
